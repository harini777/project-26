Recipe: Classic fried rice

This classic fried rice recipe is loaded with fresh mixed veggies and aromatic spices for an incredibly hearty, flavorful vegan dish. Hands-down this is one of our favorite Chinese-inspired recipes. Not only is vegetable fried rice amazingly easy to make from scratch, it’s a naturally vegan dish that’s as good for you as it is delicious to eat. You can even tweak veg fried rice to be gluten-free simply by using GF-friendly soy sauce or tamari.

PROCEDURE:

1. A great vegetable fried rice recipe begins with well-cooked white rice. To do so, first, soak 1 cup of basmati rice (190 to 200 grams) in water for 30 mins. Then drain and set rice aside.

TIP: You can opt for a good quality aged long-grained rice if you do not have Basmati rice. Jasmine rice will also work in a pinch.

2. In a large pot add 4 to 4.5 cups of water, ½ teaspoon salt, and 2 to 3 drops of toasted sesame oil (or any cooking oil), and set over high heat on the stovetop.

3. Let the water reach a full boil.

4. Add the soaked and drained basmati rice.

5. Simmer the rice uncovered on medium to medium-high heat.

6. Cook rice until al dente, or just about cooked. It’s important that you do not overcook rice during this step in order to make the best Chinese fried rice dish.

7. Quickly strain rice in a colander, and let it cool completely. Refrigerating rice for 30 minutes also helps. Simply cover cooked rice and refrigerate.

 8. Cover cooked rice and set aside to cool.

 10. While rice is cooling, finely chop the veggies. Because french beans tend to be tougher than the other mixed vegetables, I recommend chopping them very finely. You also have the option to blanch them first before adding, or you can begin cooking them in this recipe before the rest of the vegetables are added.

For my favorite version of fried rice recipe you’ll need ¼ cup of each of the following ingredients, finely chopped:

spring white onions (scallions) (not in the image below)
carrots
french beans
capsicum (bell peppers, your choice of color – green, red or yellow)

11. Now it’s time to stir-fry the vegetables. Start by heating 3 tablespoons of toasted sesame oil (or preferred cooking oil) in a wok or a deep skillet. Add 1 whole star anise and fry for a few seconds, until the oil becomes fragrant.

TIP: Use a good, trusted, heavy pan, skillet, or wok for stir-frying so that the tender fresh veggies do not get stuck or burn when frying at high heat.

12. Then add 1 teaspoon of finely chopped garlic, and ½ teaspoon finely chopped ginger. Cook for only a moment as you don’t want to brown or burn the garlic.

13. Add the chopped spring onions, and sauté for a minute or two on medium-low to medium heat.

14. Then add the finely chopped french beans – or, add these before the onions if you want a softer bean texture.

15. Continue to stir-fry both the onions and french beans for 2 to 3 minutes over medium to medium-high heat.

16. Now add the remaining finely chopped veggies, including mushrooms and celery. Increase the heat to high to thoroughly cook all of the ingredients.

17. Continuously toss and stir while frying so that the veggies are uniformly cooked and do not get burnt – for about 4 to 6 minutes. You want the vegetables to be hot and fried but still retain some great crunch.

18. You are now ready to mix the veggies and rice together to make our delicious fried rice.

20. Serve vegetable fried rice hot by itself for a light yet hearty meal, or enjoy it as a side dish along with your other favorite Chinese recipes.
